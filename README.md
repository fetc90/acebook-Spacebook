## Running Tests

We used RSpec and Capybara as our testing framework and Coveralls to ensure a high test coverage throughout development.
```
> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
```


## Approach

We approached to this project in an agile way by doing 2-day sprints with standups in the morning and retros at the end of each sprint. We also documented our workflow throughout:
- We also documented our approach in a [setup file](APPROACH.md).
- We broke down our user stories into tickets on a [team Trello](https://trello.com/b/qyOCSER0/acebook-spacebook) board and assigned ticket to pairs and made sure we rotated pairs halfway-through the day whilst keeping one member who is familiar with the codebase on the same ticket. This ensured that we all became familiar with the codebase.
- We [recorded](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qxLmJjrPnSIZuI13EKJS4rV3SMt9_AptxTFiOTG-7GU/edit?usp=sharing) our standup and retros in an execl sheet to keep track of progress on the project.
- We made a blog about our progress throughout this project. You can view that [here](https://medium.com/@spacebook3000).
